#Client

Install node.js

Run from command line:

```

    npm install
    jspm install
    npm start
    
```

#Images

Folder structure should be:

`client/img/parts/{monster_name}/{slot}.png`

After adding images, open client/img/parts/parts.tps in Texture Packer, change the location of the JSON and texture
files (they're absolute paths for the moment) and Publish Sprite Sheet.
